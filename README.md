# mc-exercise

## What went wrong in the work flow?
- Bob and Carol started their own new branch without pulling down from master first
- Bob and Carol pushed new code to their own branch (that didn't take into consideration the master), and then tried to pull it into the master
- Bob and Carol didn't confirm they were working in the most up-to-date branch
- The team didn't talk about what part of the code they were going to work on before executing on their tasks

## What should they have done?
- Pull from the master before making a new branch (Bob and Carol)
- talk about what part of the code they were planning to work on before starting
